/**
 * Handle dynamically key-value associations through a fast, efficient
 * and GC friendly cache.
 * <p>
 * Pros: <ul>
 * <li>support null values;</li>
 * <li><b>try</b> to ensure a value from being collected by the
 * GC for a specified amount of time or permanently;</li>
 * <li>if the GC decides that the memory MUST be freed, then it's free
 * to manipulate this cache;</li>
 * <li>can invalidate manually values;</li>
 * <li>very fast, as a very high amount of effort and engineering has
 * been put in the process of making this cache;</li>
 * <li>strictly defined through 4 interfaces: {@link CacheLoader},
 * {@link CacheStateExtractor}, {@link CacheReConstructor} and
 * {@link CacheRemovalHandler} (the only one that is <b>not</b>
 * optional is the loader).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Cons: <ul>
 * <li>introduction of the concept of <b>state</b>, that may confuse
 * a little initially (briefly explained in {@link CacheStateExtractor});</li>
 * <li>bad use of the resources (not following what the documentation
 * suggest) can lead to memory leaks (as for every other cache, but
 * it's worth specifying).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * When handling values' time, remember this <b>golden time rule</b>:
 * "A temporary value may become permanent, but a permanent value can't
 * become temporary unless {@link Cache#forceTime(Object, long, TimeUnit) forceTime(...)}
 * is used".
